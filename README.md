This app presents all the stuff you ever highlighted from books as a 'remember feed' with a spaced-repetition algorithm baked in.

The goal is to help you remember the most important knowledge you come across in books.

The app displays additional context upon clicking a highlight: the full paragraph where the it was made, and if you still need more context, it displays the lines before and after the paragraph.

Each highlight displays some useful metadata: the date the it was made, which book and which chapter and subchapter, the author ..etc 

It's like a self-hosted Readwise alternative, still in very early stages.
